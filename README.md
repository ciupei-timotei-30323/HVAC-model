# Overview

- This project tried to model
the thermal comfort in
indoors enviroments.

- The prediction is made in
terms of 3 categories:
    - warmer, 
    - colder, 
    - no change ,


representing the action an
HVAC system might make.

- The data required for
modeling was sourced
from the ASHRAE
Thermal Comfort
Database II.

- The dataset contained
subjective data as well
as instrumental data
and some thermal indices.

- More details can be found on my [blog](https://ciupei-timotei-30323.github.io/posts/modelling-thermal-comfort/)
